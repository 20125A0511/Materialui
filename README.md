Android Application with Student Login using material ui.

What is Material ui?

Material-UI is simply a library that allows us to import and use different components to create a user interface in our React applications. 
This saves a significant amount of time since the developers do not need to write everything from scratch.
Material-UI widgets are heavily inspired by Googleâ€™s principles on building user interfaces. 
It is, therefore, easy for developers to build visually-appealing applications.
